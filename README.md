Adding a custom app icon
========================
1. Create an .icns or .svg file with the icon you want, and copy it to the clipboard (⌘ + C).
2. Right-click the .app file of which you want to change the icon and select “Get Info” (or select the file and press ⌘ + I).
3. Select the app icon in the top left corner by clicking it once. It will get a subtle blue outline if you did it right.
4. Now hit ⌘ + V (paste) to overwrite the default icon with the new one.
